# MU Puzzle Game

This project is a Java-based puzzle game inspired by the MU Puzzle. The game starts with a welcome screen where users can enter a player ID and choose from several options. When the **Continue** button is clicked, the game panel is launched in a new window. The game panel allows users to interact with the puzzle by applying various rules to the starting string "MI" (e.g., add U, double a substring, replace "III" with "U", and remove "UU").

## Features
  
- **Game Panel (MU Puzzle GUI):**  
  - Displays the puzzle starting with the string "MI".
  - A rules section explaining the available moves.
  - Interactive text pane with character selection and highlighting.
  - Several rule buttons:
    - Rule 1: Add U if the string ends with I.
    - Rule 2: Double the substring after M.
    - Rule 3: Replace "III" with "U".
    - Rule 4: Remove "UU".
    - Placeholder buttons for additional rules.


## Future Enhancements
